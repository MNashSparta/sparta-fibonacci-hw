# Instructions

To find the value of all the even values in a Fibonacci sequence up to a max value, start by creating a new Fibonacci object:

`example = Fibonacci.new`

Then run the "fib_even" method to return the sum of the even values up to the given argument:

`example.fib_even(40000)`

or

`puts example.fib_even(40000)`

Running the fib_even command will reset the values to the start of a sequence, including the last calculated value. The last previously calculated number can be accessed from the instance variable "sum_even".
